With the most recent of these conferences having concluded, the gods unanimously decided to put humanity to an end. However, at the very last second, the eldest of the Valkyries, accompanied by the youngest, intervened and made the bold proposition to let humanity have a say in their fate by letting them go against the gods in a series of one-on-one fights to see if they are worthy of continuing to exist. Afraid to let go of their pride, the gods accept this proposal. Thirteen gods will fight against thirteen human champions. The first side to reach seven victories will decide humanity's fate.",

It takes a special kind of person to unlock the full potential of these remnants from the past, and a unique breed of humans known as O.P.T.s (or O-Parts Tacticians) become a force to be reckoned with. Unfortunately, O-Parts can be used for good or evil purposes. Jio is a young boy with a tragic past who only trusts one thing in the world: money. Little does he suspect that he is actually a very powerful O.P.T., and inside him sleeps a demon of incredible ferocity. He meets up with a girl named Ruby, and together they decide to embark on a dangerous quest to discover as many O-Parts as they can. Will Jio help Ruby realize her dream of becoming a world famous treasure hunter? More importantly, will Ruby help Jio realize his dream of--world domination?! ",
